Hello! This simple console program solves equations like ax2 + bx + c = 0 and bx + c = 0. There are two ways of using this program:
you can input coefficients yourself using the keyboard or you can run some tests from "tests.txt" file.

To run the program, i suggest using Far Manager or any other file managing app. To compile print "g++ main.cpp solver.cpp -o main",
to execute print "main".

When the program is started, you will be suggested to input 1 (to solve quadratic equation), 2 (to solve linear equation) or 3(to run tests).
Make sure to follow simple instructions which will appear in your console during the program is running. Don't worry about incorrect enter,
this program won't crash whatever the input you make :)

Hope it will be helpfull!
